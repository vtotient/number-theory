Written in python:

# Collatz Conjecture: This program implements 3n+1 algorithim. It prompts the user for n, where n is a positive integer,
# and outputs the length of the chain.

def Length(n):

    count = 0

    # Loop until n is equal to one. In other words keep the algoritim going until the chain terminates.
    while n != 1:

        # If even divide by two
        if n%2 == 0:
            n = n/2

        else :
            n = 3*n+1

        count = count + 1


    return count

# Main program:

n = int(input('Enter a value n:\n'))
n = Length(n)

print'\nThe length of the chain is:\n\n', n
